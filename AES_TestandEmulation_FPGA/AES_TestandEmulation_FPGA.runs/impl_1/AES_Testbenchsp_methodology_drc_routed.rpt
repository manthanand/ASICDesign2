2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT SCLK_OBUF_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT SCLK_OBUF_BUFG_inst_i_4 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin instance_name/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_100_cntr_reg[0]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[10]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[11]/C,
clk_100_cntr_reg[1]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[2]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[3]/C,
clk_100_cntr_reg[4]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[5]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[6]/C,
clk_100_cntr_reg[7]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[8]/C, clk_100_cntr_reg[9]/C,
clk_10_reg/C, clk_20_reg/C, clk_5_reg/C (the first 15 of 21 listed)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation

Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.004 ns between clk_450_cntr_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0) and clk_450_cntr_reg[6]/R (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.004 ns between clk_450_cntr_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0) and clk_450_cntr_reg[7]/R (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.027 ns between clk_450_cntr_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0) and clk_450_cntr_reg[11]_replica_1/R (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.666 ns between clk_450_cntr_reg[10]/C (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0) and clk_75_reg/D (clocked by clk_450_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
